# Predict-Student-Performance-From-GamePlay

My workbook for the 'Predict Student Performance from GamePlay' Kaggle competition

Goal of the Competition
The goal of this competition is to predict student performance during game-based learning in real-time. You'll develop a model trained on one of the largest open datasets of game logs.

Your work will help advance research into knowledge-tracing methods for game-based learning. You'll be supporting developers of educational games to create more effective learning experiences for students.

Context
Learning is meant to be fun, which is where game-based learning comes in. This educational approach allows students to engage with educational content inside a game framework, making it enjoyable and dynamic. Although game-based learning is being used in a growing number of educational settings, there are still a limited number of open datasets available to apply data science and learning analytic principles to improve game-based learning.

Most game-based learning platforms do not sufficiently make use of knowledge tracing to support individual students. Knowledge tracing methods have been developed and studied in the context of online learning environments and intelligent tutoring systems. But there has been less focus on knowledge tracing in educational games.

Competition host Field Day Lab is a publicly-funded research lab at the Wisconsin Center for Educational Research. They design games for many subjects and age groups that bring contemporary research to the public, making use of the game data to understand how people learn. Field Day Lab's commitment to accessibility ensures all of its games are free and available to anyone. The lab also partners with ​​​nonprofits like The Learning Agency Lab, which is focused on developing science of learning-based tools and programs for the social good.

If successful, you'll enable game developers to improve educational games and further support the educators who use these games with dashboards and analytic tools. In turn, we might see broader support for game-based learning platforms.
